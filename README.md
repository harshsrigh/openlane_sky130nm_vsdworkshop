# OpenLANE Workshop

This repository used to document the progress of the 5-days workshop on Physical design using OpenLANE flow(an orchestra of open source tools put together to build/create an open source community of digital and analog IP's).

## Day Progress & Learnings

During the workshop, most of the labs are performed using a pre-coded picorv32a project.

## Day 1: Introduction to OpenLANE Flow

### Lab Work

#### Invoking OpenLANE

1. Invoking the openLANE using `./flow.tcl -interactive`.
   The chip design is an iterative process, hence interactive mode offers better control and flexibility.

2. Load required dependencies of openLANE using following Command.
   `package require openlane 0.9`
